# Ticket Documentation System

This system helps developers automatically generate comprehensive ticket documentation for future reference.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Automated Script (Recommended)
```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd /path/to/attributes_platform

# Run the helper script with your ticket ID
./ai/prompts/ticket-doc-helper.sh ACG-123

# Or specify developer name explicitly
./ai/prompts/ticket-doc-helper.sh ACG-123 "Your Name"
```

### Option 2: Manual Process
1. Open `ai/prompts/ticket-documentation-generator.md`
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions
3. Use the provided template to create your ticket documentation

## What Gets Generated

The system creates a comprehensive markdown file at `ai/tickets/TICKET-ID.md` containing:

- **Developer attribution** and timestamps
- **Git commit history** related to the ticket
- **File changes** with placeholders for descriptions
- **Endpoints affected** by the changes
- **Implementation details** template
- **Testing information** 
- **Performance considerations**
- **Future maintenance notes**

## Output Location

All ticket documentation is saved in:
```
ai/tickets/
├── TICKET-123.md
├── TICKET-124.md
└── templates/
    └── ticket.md
```

## Features

✅ **Auto-detects Git changes** from recent commits  
✅ **Includes developer name** from Git config  
✅ **Analyzes modified files** (controllers, routes, tests)  
✅ **Creates structured documentation** with consistent format  
✅ **Preserves existing files** with automatic backup  
✅ **Provides completion checklist** for manual review  

## Example Usage

```bash
# After completing work on ticket ACG-89
./ai/prompts/ticket-doc-helper.sh ACG-89

# Output: ai/tickets/ACG-89.md with pre-filled information
```

## Manual Review Required

After generation, please review and complete:
- [ ] Add brief title description
- [ ] Include JIRA and PR links
- [ ] Describe what each modified file does
- [ ] Document implementation decisions
- [ ] Rate ticket complexity (1-5 stars)
- [ ] Add testing details
- [ ] Note any future considerations

## Benefits for Future Development

These ticket documentation files serve as:
- **Reference material** for similar future tickets
- **Onboarding documentation** for new team members
- **Architecture decision records** for the codebase
- **Performance baseline** tracking over time
- **Testing strategy** examples and patterns

## Integration with AI Mapping

The ticket documentation works with the AI rule mapping system:
- Reference `ai/mapping-loy copy.md` for endpoint-specific rules
- Link related tickets working on similar endpoints
- Build knowledge base of common patterns and solutions
